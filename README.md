# SUPERSCALAR_CPU
This project implements a simple 2-way superscalar in-order pipelined RISC-V CPU, built collaboratively in VHDL and Verilog.

It extends the concepts of a classic 5-stage pipeline by allowing the CPU to fetch, decode, execute, and commit up to 2 instructions per cycle ‚Äî increasing throughput while keeping the design modular and understandable.

The design uses a combination of VHDL and Verilog modules to support team collaboration and maintain flexibility across different toolchains.

## Key Features
- 2-way superscalar pipeline (dual-issue)
- Mixed VHDL + Verilog design (team-friendly and tool-friendly)
- 4-read / 2-write register file
- Refactored ALU with multi-issue support
- Forwarding and hazard detection for dual-issue
- Randomized verification (> 10,000 cases)
- Clean modular structure ‚Äî extensible toward out-of-order
- Waveform-based debugging for education and verification

## Goals
- Learn practical superscalar CPU design
- Apply and extend concepts from previous single-issue pipeline
- Build a solid base for future out-of-order CPU
- Practice mixed VHDL + Verilog integration (real-world skill)
- Document progress for portfolio and collaboration

## Status
**In progress**:
- Architecture planning complete
- Register file (4R / 2W) being implemented (Verilog)
- Decoder + ALU refactoring (VHDL) with verification ongoing
