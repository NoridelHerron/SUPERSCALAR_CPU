# SUPERSCALAR_CPU

This project implements a 2-way superscalar, in-order, 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU built collaboratively in VHDL and Verilog.

It extends the classic 5-stage pipeline to fetch, decode, execute, and commit up to two instructions per cycle, while keeping the design intentionally simple so I could focus on mastering data hazard handling, forwarding, and advanced verification workflows. The architecture is modular and clear, making it an effective learning platform as well as a foundation for future designs.

## Key Features

- Dual-issue, in-order 5-stage pipeline â€” simplified for targeted learning goals
- Mixed VHDL + Verilog implementation for team flexibility and toolchain compatibility
- 4-read / 2-write register file for parallel operand access
- Refactored ALU with multi-issue capability
- Forwarding and hazard detection tuned for dual-issue execution
- Randomized verification with 10,000+ test cases
- Waveform-driven debugging for deep visibility into pipeline behavior
- Clean, modular structure â€” extensible toward more advanced architectures

## Project Goals

- Master data hazard detection and resolution in a superscalar pipeline
- Implement and refine forwarding logic for dual-issue execution
- Develop robust randomized testbenches for module- and system-level verification
- Gain proficiency in waveform debugging for both functional and performance analysis
