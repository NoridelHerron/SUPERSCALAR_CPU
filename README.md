# SUPERSCALAR_CPU
This project implements a simple 2-way superscalar in-order pipelined RISC-V CPU, built collaboratively in VHDL and Verilog.

It extends the concepts of a classic 5-stage pipeline by allowing the CPU to fetch, decode, execute, and commit up to 2 instructions per cycle ‚Äî increasing throughput while keeping the design modular and understandable.

The design uses a combination of VHDL and Verilog modules to support team collaboration and maintain flexibility across different toolchains.

## Key Features
- 2-way superscalar pipeline (dual-issue)
- Mixed VHDL + Verilog design (team-friendly and tool-friendly)
- 4-read / 2-write register file
- Refactored ALU with multi-issue support
- Forwarding and hazard detection for dual-issue
- Randomized verification (> 10,000 cases)
- Clean modular structure ‚Äî extensible toward out-of-order
- Waveform-based debugging for education and verification

## Goals
- Learn practical superscalar CPU design
- Apply and extend concepts from previous single-issue pipeline
- Build a solid base for future out-of-order CPU
- Practice mixed VHDL + Verilog integration (real-world skill)
- Document progress for portfolio and collaboration

## Designs
### HAZARD DETECTION UNIT (HDU)
![Hazard diagram](images/Hazard_Guide.jpg)
Note: This is how I implemented the HDU to detect hazards

The hazard detection unit (HDU) is responsible for identifying data hazards between instructions in a dual-issue superscalar pipeline. To implement this, I followed a structured approach based on a dependency diagram I sketched to visualize potential conflicts across pipeline stages.

For instruction A in the ID_EX stage, I check for hazards by comparing its source registers against the destination registers of instructions ahead in the pipeline. The priority of checks is as follows:
- EX_MEM.A
- EX_MEM.B
- MEM_WB.A
- MEM_WB.B

This priority order ensures that the most recent results (from closer pipeline stages) are considered first for potential forwarding.

For load-use hazards, instruction A in the ID stage is compared specifically against both instructions in the ID_EX stage to determine whether a stall is required.

For instruction B, the logic is more complex due to its possible dependency on instruction A, which is issued in the same cycle. This stall is not limited to load-use hazards; any data dependency where B needs to use the output of A when it is reg write, B is require to stall, otherwise it will read the register too early. Therefore, the first check is whether instruction B depends on instruction A and whether instruction A intends to write (RegWrite asserted).

If no such dependency exists, hazard detection continues for instruction B using the same priority order as instruction A:
- EX_MEM.A
- EX_MEM.B
- MEM_WB.A
- MEM_WB.B

If no hazard is detected after these checks, then no action (stall or forward) is taken.

This hierarchy ensures correct data forwarding and minimal pipeline stalling while maintaining proper instruction execution order.

The image above demonstrates that the hazard detection unit is functioning correctly. Several dependency cases have been highlighted to illustrate how hazards are identified and handled. Additional screenshots are included to show more examples of detected hazards across different scenarios for both instruction A and B.

### ALU UNIT
I refactored both the adder and subtractor modules to make them reusable by removing flag generation from their logic. Instead, result computation and flag generation are now centralized in the ALU unit. Additionally, I introduced an enumerated type for ALU operations to improve code readability and simplify debugging. After refactoring, the adder, subtractor, and ALU unit were fully re-verified with 20,000 test cases.

### DECODER
The Decoder module is designed with a single 32-bit instruction input and a single output structured as a record type. This output aggregates all decoded fields, including opcode, function codes, register indices, and the unshifted immediate value. Resizing and alignment of the immediate field are deferred to the top-level logic within the Instruction Decode (ID) stage. It was also fully verified with 20,000 test cases.

The decoder is fully compliant with the RISC-V instruction set reference and supports all instruction formats. For verification, a dedicated testbench was developed that generates randomized 32-bit values, constrained to ensure only valid RISC-V instructions are produced.

### Control Unit
The Control Unit accepts a single input: the 7-bit opcode extracted from the instruction. Based on the opcode, it outputs a structured record containing all relevant control signals required by the datapath. Each control signal is deterministically derived from the opcode type, enabling precise configuration of the processor‚Äôs behavior for each instruction class (e.g., R-type, I-type, S-type, etc.).

The use of a record output improves clarity and modularity, making the control logic easier to extend or debug in future design iterations.
